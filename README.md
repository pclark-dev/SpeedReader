## About

SpeedReader allows you to improve the efficiency of your reading by promoting points of focus in the text without requireing complete registration of the work itself.
Our brains have a sort of autocorrect which is what is taken advantage of in this tool.

To allow for the use of links in this project, BeautifulSoup4 is used for webscraping with the held of NLTK's stopwords to help format the data.

CustomTkinter is used for an easy-on-the-eyes UI


## Usage

### Source

You have the option of either pasting in text from a source by selecting the 'Text' button

or

You can paste a Wikipedia link with your desired content to process by selecting the 'Link' button

### Formatting

The first entry box is to select what percent of every word to bold

The second entry specifies the font size to display the text in

### Note

There is currently no feature to update the text live with the above customization option so a 'Clear' button is provided to wipe the input/ouput box clean
